# Find Contours

This layer \(`find_contours`\) extracts contours from bitmaps and stores results as polygons.

```javascript
{
  "src": [
    "$sample1"
  ],
  "dst": "$sample2",
  "action": "find_contours",
  "settings": {
    "classes_mapping": {
      "my-mask": "found-contours"
    }
  }
}
```

For each figure of class "my-mask" this will find contours \(with OpenCV `findContours`\), and the found contours will be stored as objects of shape "polygon" \(class "found-contours"\).

Holes in source masks produce holes in polygons \(with two-level hierarchy of borders\).

## Settings

* `classes_mapping` â€” dict where keys are existing classes of shape `bitmap`, and values are new names of classes.

## Example

Example of usage may be found [here](https://github.com/TDionis/gitbook-test-2/tree/6674a9367498cf90a3f4b6119416152b98b80b92/export/examples/vectorize-bitmap/README.md#find-contours).
