# Sliding Window

This layer \(`sliding_window`\) is used to crop part of image with its annotations by sliding of window from left to rigth, from top to bottom.

```javascript
{
  "action": "sliding_window",
  "src": ["$sample1"],
  "dst": "$sample2",
  "settings": {
    "window": {
      "width": 128,
      "height": 128
    },
    "min_overlap": {
      "x": 32,
      "y": 32
    }
  }
}
```

## Settings

* `window`
  * `width` — sliding window width
  * `height` — sliding window height
* `min_overlap`
  * `x` — sliding window overlap `x` \(must be less than sliding window width, minimal `1`px\) 
  * `y` — sliding window overlap `y` \(must be less than sliding window height, minimal `1`px\)
