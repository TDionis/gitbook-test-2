This layer (`duplicate_objects`) clones figures of required classes.

```json
{
  "dst": "$sample2",
  "src": [
    "$sample1"
  ],
  "action": "duplicate_objects",
  "settings": {
    "classes_mapping": {
      "bitmap-one": "bitmap-two"
    }
  }
}
```

For the settings above, each figure of class "bitmap-one" will be cloned with class "bitmap-two", leaving the source figure unchanged. This _will not_ create new sample (new image), so both source and resulting figures will belong to the same image.

## Settings

- `classes_mapping` â€” dict where keys are existing classes, and values are new names of classes.

## Example

Example of usage may be found [here](/export/examples/vectorize-bitmap/#duplicate-objects-for-complicated-conversions).
