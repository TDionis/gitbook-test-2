Save masks layer (`save_masks`) gives you an opportunity to get masked representations of data besides just images and annotations that you can get using [save](/export/save) layer. It includes machine and human representations.

In machine masks each of listed classes are colored in shades of gray that you specify. Note that black color [0, 0, 0] is automatically assigned with the background. In human masks you would get stacked original images with that images having class colors above (see example).

```json
 {
  "action": "save_masks",
  "src": [
    "$0"
  ],
  "dst": "experiment001",
  "settings": {
    "masks_machine": true,
    "masks_human": true,
    "gt_machine_color": {
      "kiwi": [
        100,
        100,
        100
      ],
      "lemon": [
        200,
        200,
        200
      ]
    },
    "gt_human_color": {
      "kiwi": [
        255,
        0,
        0
      ],
      "lemon": [
        27,
        0,
        255
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In an example above, dataset sample from lemons project is exported as masks. The following parameters specify the output format:

* `masks_machine` — true if machine readable masks are generated.

* `masks_human` — true if human readable masks are generated.

* `gt_machine_color`: specifies colors of generated masks for each class exported.

    * for class "kiwi" machine color is defined by RGB=(100,100,100)
    * for class "lemon" machine color is defined by RGB=(200,200,200)

* `gt_human_color`: specifies colors of generated masks for each class exported used in visual representation

    * for class "kiwi" machine color is defined by RGB=(255,0,0).
    * for class "lemon" machine color is defined by RGB=(27,0,255)

After downloading generated results, the following folders are created:

* ann — contains json annotations for each image
* img — contains raw images
* masks_human — contains visual representation of generated mask
* masks_machine — generated masks

The example of masks_human is given below:

Here is an example of masks_machine:
