This layer (`skeletonize`) extracts skeletons from bitmap figures.

```json
{
  "src": [
    "$sample1"
  ],
  "dst": "$sample2",
  "action": "skeletonize",
  "settings": {
    "method": "thinning",
    "classes": [
      "cool-bitmap"
    ]
  }
}
```

Each figure of class "cool-bitmap" will be reduced to 1 pixel wide representation. Each source mask (figure of shape "bitmap") produces one resulting mask (shape "bitmap").

It uses *scikit-image* as a backend, so three methods of skeletonization are provided. For more information, look [here](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/edges/plot_skeleton.html).

{% hint style="info" %}
For large images it may be... not fast.
{% endhint %}

## Settings

- `classes` — list of classes to apply transformation. Only classes with shape "bitmap" are allowed.
- `method` (type: enum ["skeletonization", "medial_axis", "thinning"]) — algorithm of processing.

## Example

Illustrated example of usage may be found [here](/export/examples/vectorize-bitmap/#get-skeleton).
