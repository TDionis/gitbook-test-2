# Workspaces

When multiple users are collaborating together in the same team it is usually convenient to have a way to split results into separate "rooms" called "workspaces".

Workspace is filter inside a particular team that allows to quickly switch between different sets of experiments. There are three resources that are split between workspaces:

* Projects and datasets
* Neural networks
* Tasks

A workspace is a part of a team. You cannot have a workspace outside of a team. Every team must have at least one workspace, but can have two or more.

At every moment you work in particular workspace and all projects, neural networks and tasks you create become a part of the current workspace and the current team.

Workspaces do not provide any access permissions or roles mechanisms, unlike teams.
