# First steps

Sounds good, huh? Onboarding takes no more than five minutes, so let's go! 💥

## 🏁 Create an account

Supervisely is free for non-commercial usage and requires no card info. Go to the [**signup page**](https://app.supervise.ly/signup), choose login and password to create your personal account. You can sign in through the GitHub or Google Account too.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you feel Supervisely is the right fit for you and your company, feel free to [contact us](https://supervise.ly/contact) and get an Enterprise Edition — a self-hosted version with advanced data security, customization and [more](https://supervise.ly/enterprise)!
{% endhint %}

## 👋 Invite more people

When you create an account we automatically create a new **team** for you that has the same name as your login. You are the only member right now — but you can invite your colleagues and work on the same data together!

## 📂 Import some data

Go to the **import** page and create a new **project** by uploading some data: images \(.png, .jpg\), videos \(.mp4, .avi\), 3D point clouds \(.pcd\) or even well known dataset formats like KITTY and PascalVOC.

We support such a variety of formats using **plugins** concept: and you can always add your own!

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't have any datasets yet? We do! Check out our **explore** section and grab yourself a sample project.
{% endhint %}

## 🔍 Explore your data

Go to the **projects** page to see your new project: a set of datasets \(aka folders\) that share the same settings, defined tags and so on. Click on a dataset to open corresponding annotation tool and create some polygons or bitmaps or tag your images.

## 🖥 Connect your PC and run a neural net

Get some benefit from your datasets — train a new neural network or apply an existing one. By the way, we have a bunch of them in our model zoo: like UNet or DeepLab.

Before you start, you need to connect a computer with GPU on board to the platform, so that you can deploy new tasks right from the web interface.

Thankfully, it's super easy to do: just add a new **agent** at the **cluster** page and run the one-liner on your computer: that's it!

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't have a computer with GPU, no worries: in the modal window you will get a link to the AWI and rent an AWS instance.
{% endhint %}

## Next Steps

Now you know the basics, but there is so much more to explore! Data augmentation, consensus labeling, data statistics and visualization, Python SDK and API and even more.
